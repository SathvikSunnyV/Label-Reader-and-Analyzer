**Backend Documentation**

Day 1 (28 09 2025):
Asked gpt models to write a boilerplate code
tailored it in a way that it suits the project structure
faced issues with api routes and functionality of Database's management code

Tomorrow:
* I will be adding the alternatives of few food products to the Database
* will be checking the code by dummy codes
* will wait for checking endpoints (scraper module, ai module, and frontend)
